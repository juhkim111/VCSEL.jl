    genotype_kernel(Gobs, weights_beta, geno_kernel)

Constructs genotype kernel based on options: G[i] = Gobs[i] * W * I if geno_kernel = "SKAT"
OR G[i] = Gobs[i] * W * ones(qi) if geno_kernel = "Burden" where W is a diagonal matrix whose
entries are weights. Each G[i] is divided by square root of frobenius norm of G[i]*transpose(G[i]).

# Input
- obs:
